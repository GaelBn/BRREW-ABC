BRREWABC (Batched Resilient and Rapid Estimation Workflow through Approximate Bayesian Computation) : an R package designed to facilitate inference through a parallelized Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC SMC) algorithm. This package streamlines the process of conducting Bayesian inference for complex models by implementing efficient parallelization techniques.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BRREWABC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GaelBn/BRREWABC")
```

## Usage

For a basic example, see the [Get Started](`vignette("BRREWABC")`) section.

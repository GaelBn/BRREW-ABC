BRREW-ABC (Batched Resilient and Rapid Estimation Workflow through Approximate Bayesian Computation) : an R package designed to facilitate inference through a parallelized Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC SMC) algorithm. This package streamlines the process of conducting Bayesian inference for complex models by implementing efficient parallelization techniques.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BRREWABC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GaelBn/BRREW-ABC")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(BRREWABC)

# model definition
compute_dist = function(x, ss_obs){
    ss_sim = c( x[["alpha"]] + x[["beta"]] + rnorm(1,0,0.1),
           x[["alpha"]] * x[["beta"]] + rnorm(1,0,0.1) ) # a very simple toy model
    dist = sum((ss_sim-ss_obs)^2)
    return(c(dist))
}

MODEL_LIST <- list("m1" = compute_dist)
PRIOR_DIST <- list("m1" = list(c('alpha', 'unif', 0, 4), c('beta', 'unif', 0, 1)))

# create a reference trajectory
sum_stat_obs = c(2.0,0.75)

# run abc smc procedure
res = abcsmc(model_list = MODEL_LIST, prior_dist = PRIOR_DIST,
  ss_obs = sum_stat_obs, max_number_of_gen = 10, nb_acc_prtcl_per_gen = 1000,
  new_threshold_quantile = 0.8, experiment_folderpath = "",
  max_concurrent_jobs = 2, verbose = TRUE)

# get results and plots
all_accepted_particles = res$particles
all_thresholds = res$thresholds
plot_abcsmc_res(data = all_accepted_particles, prior = PRIOR_DIST, colorpal = "GnBu")
plot_densityridges(data = all_accepted_particles, prior = PRIOR_DIST, colorpal = "GnBu")
plot_thresholds(data = all_thresholds, nb_threshold = 1, colorpal = "GnBu")
```

<!-- ```{r pairplot, echo = FALSE}
plot_abcsmc_res(data = all_accepted_particles, prior = PRIOR_DIST, colorpal = "GnBu")
``` -->

BRREW-ABC (Batched Resilient and Rapid Estimation Workflow through Approximate Bayesian Computation) : an R package designed to facilitate inference through a parallelized Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC SMC) algorithm. This package streamlines the process of conducting Bayesian inference for complex models by implementing efficient parallelization techniques.

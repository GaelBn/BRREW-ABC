BRREWABC (Batched Resilient and Rapid Estimation Workflow through
Approximate Bayesian Computation) : an R package designed to facilitate
inference through a parallelized Approximate Bayesian Computation
Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC SMC) algorithm. This package streamlines the
process of conducting Bayesian inference for complex models by
implementing efficient parallelization techniques.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BRREWABC from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GaelBn/BRREWABC")
```

## Usage

For a basic example, see the Get started section.
